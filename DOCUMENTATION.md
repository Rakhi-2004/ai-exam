## 4. Component Documentation

### 4.1 Navbar Component
The Navbar component provides navigation functionality and user interface elements.

```jsx
// src/components/Navbar.jsx
const Navbar = () => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### 4.2 Footer Component
The Footer component displays copyright information and additional links.

```jsx
// src/components/Footer.jsx
const Footer = () => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### 4.3 Layout Component
The Layout component provides the basic structure for all pages.

```jsx
// src/components/Layout.jsx
const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

## 5. Page Documentation

### 5.1 Home Page
The Home page serves as the landing page of the application.

```jsx
// src/pages/Home.jsx
const Home = () => {
  // Page implementation
};
```

### 5.2 Exam Page
The Exam page handles the main examination interface.

```jsx
// src/pages/Exam.jsx
const Exam = () => {
  // Page implementation
};
```

## 6. State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management capabilities:
- useState for local component state
